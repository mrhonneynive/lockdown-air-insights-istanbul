# lockdown-air-insights-istanbul
This repository hosts an R-based analysis of Istanbul's air quality during the COVID-19 lockdown. The impact of reduced industrial activity and traffic on key pollutants were investigated by utilizing electricity consumption data as a proxy for industrial activity. The project aims to provide insights that can be used for environmental policies.
